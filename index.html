  <font size="5" color="white">My name is Jesus, and I am a sophomore at Summit Rainier. I was born here in San Jose, but my parents are from Mexico. I have only ever been to two countries: Mexico and the U.S.A. Also, I speak English and Spanish. I have enjoyed living here in San
    Jose, but I feel like a trip to Sinaloa, Mexico is long overdue.

      <font size="5" color="white"> I have two brothers and one sister. My sister is younger than me and so is one of my brothers. My mom is 44,and my dad is 46. My grandma a.k.a my yaya also lives with us. I can't forget about my Aunt Silvia. She lives next to us, but to me she is
        like another mom. That is pretty much my family or my direct family at least. </font>

     <font size="5" color="white"> My favorite movie ever is “In Time.” I just really like that movie, and I have always liked dystopian movies. Also, burgers are my favorite food. They are just really delicious especially the ones from In and out. I like playing video games especially
    if I am with my friends. I have been playing since I was a kid, and I think there is something really fun about playing video games with my friends. Also, I like movies and shows. I do watch a lot of Netflix as well. Sometimes I go swimming, because
      it is pretty fun for me </font></p>
